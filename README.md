# Research Repository: Complexity Theory and NP-Hard Problems

## Overview

This repository contains research on various NP-hard problems as part of our study in complexity theory. Specifically, it includes work on the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) and the Knapsack Problem.

## Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

- `VRP/`:By Vincnet. Contains all the resources, code, and documentation related to the Vehicle Routing Problem.
- `Knapsack/`:By Chenyun. Contains all the resources, code, and documentation related to the Knapsack Problem.

Each directory includes subdirectories for data, algorithms, results, and reports.

## Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)

### Description

The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a combinatorial optimization and integer programming problem which seeks to service a number of customers with a fleet of vehicles. The goal is to determine the optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles to traverse in order to deliver to a given set of customers.

### Contents

- `data/`: Contains datasets used for VRP experiments.
- `algorithms/`: Contains implementations of various VRP algorithms, including heuristic and exact methods.
- `results/`: Contains results from VRP experiments, including performance metrics and analysis.
- `report/`: Contains the research report detailing the methods, experiments, and findings related to VRP.

### Usage

1. Navigate to the `VRP/` directory.
2. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file within the `VRP/` directory for setting up and running the VRP algorithms.
3. Use the scripts in the `algorithms/` directory to execute specific VRP algorithms and analyze the results in the `results/` directory.

## Knapsack Problem

### Description

The Knapsack Problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization where the objective is to maximize the total value of items placed in a knapsack without exceeding its capacity. This problem has many variations and is a fundamental problem in theoretical computer science.

### Contents

- `data/`: Contains datasets used for Knapsack Problem experiments.
- `algorithms/`: Contains implementations of various Knapsack Problem algorithms, including dynamic programming and greedy methods.
- `results/`: Contains results from Knapsack Problem experiments, including performance metrics and analysis.
- `report/`: Contains the research report detailing the methods, experiments, and findings related to the Knapsack Problem.

### Usage

1. Navigate to the `Knapsack/` directory.
2. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file within the `Knapsack/` directory for setting up and running the Knapsack Problem algorithms.
3. Use the scripts in the `algorithms/` directory to execute specific Knapsack Problem algorithms and analyze the results in the `results/` directory.
